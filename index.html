      <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
      <p>
        I am an experienced Web Merchandise Analyst with over four years in the
        e-commerce industry, now transitioning into software development. My
        interest in web development began during my time as a Web Merchandise
        Analyst, leading me to explore and gradually learn the fundamentals. I
        joined the AltSchool program to solidify my knowledge, enhance my
        skills, and gain a structured learning experience in the field. My goal
        by the end of the School of Engineering program is to become a
        full-stack developer, working on projects that address real-world
        problems. Additionally, I aspire to give back to my community by
        equipping others with the knowledge and opportunities to pursue a
        similar path in tech.
